### How Does Testomato Work?

[Testomato](https://www.testomato.com) is an easy automated monitoring 
service that actively monitors your website without requiring advanced
technical knowledge or complicated maintenance, allowing you to check
your website for problems that impact users directly. This article 
will give you a quick overview of how Testomato works.

In order to monitor your website, Testomato downloads and scans your
HTML code in a way similar to other popular web crawlers (like
Googlebot). However, we use our own crawler, the 
[Testomatobot](https://www.testomato.com/bot)

Testomato downloads your HTML source code in order to run checks, but it
does not execute any of the JavaScript on your website. This means that
while we can catch errors in your UI just like a common user would, we
do not run your website in a browser and are unable to find problems
that may occur across different browsers.

### What Does Testomato Do?

Modern websites require many complex and critical actions to work
correctly. Most of the time everything works great, but even if your
website is available, there may be parts that are slow or broken. And
these problems can sometimes take days, or even weeks, to find.

With Testomato, you can discover issues as they happen to minimize the
impact of those issues on your users and prevent your business from
losing new signups, current customers, and revenue.

Testomato allows you to set automated checks to monitor your website for
problems that interfere with the normal operation of your business,
alerting you when something goes wrong.

You can set up simple checks in seconds to monitor for:

* Web pages and forms
* Password-protected pages
* Important SEO indicators
* Common error messages
* HTTP status codes
* Missing content or broken forms
* Network & SSL issues
* Uptime monitoring
* Response time

All website monitoring results are organized and stored in easy-to-read
reports, allowing you to identify error patterns and make responsible
decisions based on reliable data.

[Team Testomato](https://www.testomato.com/team) is always working
hard to improve and expand the features we have available.

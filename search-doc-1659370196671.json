Imagine your application has a /user/email route that accepts aPOST request to change the authenticated user's email address. Most likely, this route expects an email input field to contain the email address the user would like to begin using. Without CSRF protection, a malicious website could create an HTML form that points to your application's /user/email route and submits the malicious user's own email address &lt;form action=&quot;https://your-application.com/user/email&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;email&quot; value=&quot;malicious-email@example.com&quot;&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;script&gt; document.forms[0].submit(); &lt;/script&gt;  "},{"title":"Preventing CSRF Requests​","type":1,"pageTitle":"CSRF protection","url":"checks/CSRF-protection#preventing-csrf-requests","content":"You can generate CSRF &quot;token&quot; for each active user session managed by the application.
